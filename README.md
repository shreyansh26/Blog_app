Blog
====

This is a blog webpage with options for the user to post articles and comment on them.
The blog also provides user authentication for users to SignIn, SignUp, and even reset their password if forgotten. Although currently, the confirmation mail is not sent to the user because I do not have any SMTP server set up yet. Howevwe, if run locally, the sample mail can be seeen in the logs.
